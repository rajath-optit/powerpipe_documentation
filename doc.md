If you have two users on the same Linux VM and you want each user to manage different AWS accounts, you can configure AWS profiles separately for each user. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
1. Create Two Users on the Same Linux VM:
If you haven't already created the two users, you can do so with the following commands:
bashCopy codesudo adduser user1
sudo adduser user2
2. Configure AWS Profiles for Each User:
Each user will have their own home directory, so they can configure their AWS CLI independently.
For user1:
Switch to user1:
Configure AWS for user1:
 
This will create the AWS credentials file in /home/user1/.aws/credentials and /home/user1/.aws/config.
Export the Profile for user1:
For user2:
Switch to user2:
Configure AWS for user2:
 
This will create the AWS credentials file in /home/user2/.aws/credentials and /home/user2/.aws/config.
Export the Profile for user2:
3. Using the Profiles:
Now, when user1 runs AWS commands, they will use the account1 profile, and user2 will use the account2 profile.
For user1:
bashCopy codeaws s3 ls --profile account1
For user2:
bashCopy codeaws s3 ls --profile account2
4. Maintaining Separate Environments:
Each user will have separate environments. If user1 exports AWS_PROFILE=account1, it will only affect user1's session. Similarly, user2 can export AWS_PROFILE=account2 without affecting user1's session.
5. Switching Between Users:
You can switch between the users using su:
Switch to user1:
Switch to user2:
Each user's AWS configuration remains separate, allowing them to manage different AWS accounts without interfering with each other.
6. Persistent Configuration:
If you want the AWS profile to be automatically set when a user logs in, you can add the export command to the user's .bashrc or .zshrc file.
For user1:
bashCopy codeecho 'export AWS_PROFILE=account1' >> ~/.bashrc
For user2:
bashCopy codeecho 'export AWS_PROFILE=account2' >> ~/.bashrc
 
bashCopy codesu - user2
bashCopy codesu - user1
bashCopy codeexport AWS_PROFILE=account2
bashCopy codeaws configure --profile account2
bashCopy codesu - user2
bashCopy codeexport AWS_PROFILE=account1
bashCopy codeaws configure --profile account1
bashCopy codesu - user1
