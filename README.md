 Introduction 

This documentation outlines the process and findings of our comparison between SOC 2 controls in AWS and GCP using Powerpipe, an open-source tool from Turbot. The comparison aims to facilitate the creation of SOC 2 benchmarks for GCP and supports the development of new modules, controls, and benchmarks across cloud platforms. 

  

 Purpose of the Document 

This document provides a comprehensive comparison between the SOC 2 controls of AWS and GCP, facilitated through Powerpipe. The comparisons cover: 

1. SOC 2 Controls in AWS vs. GCP 

2. Benchmarks and Collected Data for SOC 2 Creation in GCP 

3. Table Name Analysis Between AWS and GCP 

These comparisons are aimed at serving as references for continuing the development of SOC 2 controls for GCP and can be extended to other new benchmarks or controls. 

 
Overview 
 
Turbot Pipes is the underlying platform that adds intelligence, automation, and security specifically for DevOps processes. 
 

Powerpipe is an open-source tool designed for DevOps teams to: 

- Visualize Cloud Infrastructure: Provides pre-built dashboards for AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more, allowing teams to visualize cloud resources, track costs, usage, and relationships. 

- Run Security & Compliance Benchmarks: Offers pre-built benchmarks to assess compliance with various standards like CIS, GDPR, NIST, PCI, SOC 2, etc. 

- Create Custom Dashboards & Benchmarks: Supports building custom dashboards and benchmarks using HCL in a live coding environment. 
 

Steampipe Integration: Powerpipe often integrates with Steampipe, a tool that allows querying cloud environments using SQL, enhancing reporting and querying capabilities.

Understanding SOC Compliance 

  

SOC 1 

- Purpose: Used by finance companies to check the correct implementation of controls. 

- Scope: One-time report covering a specific period. 

  

SOC 2 

- Purpose: Focuses on cybersecurity for IT organizations dealing with customer data. 

- Scope: Continuous evaluation to ensure effective controls over time. 

  

SOC 2 Compliance Principles 

- Security 

- Availability 

- Processing Integrity 

- Confidentiality 

- Privacy 

  

SOC 3 

- Purpose: A public disclosure version of SOC 2. 
 

SOC 2 Compliance on Google Cloud 

SOC 2 compliance is crucial for organizations handling sensitive customer data, ensuring they meet rigorous security and privacy standards. Google Cloud offers several tools to assist enterprises in preparing for and maintaining SOC 2 compliance. 

  

1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Google Cloud 

- Overview: IAM controls access to cloud resources, allowing precise management of permissions. 

- Relevance to SOC 2: Enforces access control policies, ensuring only authorized personnel access data and resources. 

  

2. Key Management Service (KMS) on Google Cloud 

- Overview: Provides secure management of encryption keys for data protection. 

- Relevance to SOC 2: Ensures data encryption at rest and in transit and generates audit logs of key usage. 

  

3. Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) 

- Overview: Centralized management and monitoring of security risks. 

- Relevance to SOC 2: Supports continuous monitoring and risk management. 

  

4. Google Cloud Audit Logs 

- Overview: Records all activities within the cloud environment, including user actions and system changes. 

- Relevance to SOC 2: Provides detailed records for audit trails and incident response. 

  

5. Google Cloud VPN (Virtual Private Network) 

- Overview: Securely connects on-premises networks to Google Cloud, encrypting communications. 

- Relevance to SOC 2: Ensures secure transmission of data in transit. 

  

Conclusion 

  

Preparing for SOC 2 compliance on Google Cloud involves understanding compliance requirements and utilizing the right tools. By leveraging IAM, KMS, SCC, Audit Logs, and VPN services, organizations can ensure SOC 2 compliance and protect customer data effectively.

Why SOC 2 Compliance Is Necessary for AWS Users 

  

AWS is SOC 2 compliant, but organizations must manage their own data and applications. Tools like Powerpipe help manage aspects of SOC 2 compliance, including encryption, data protection, and monitoring.
